Thinking about motivation and how to motivate, I came to a conclusion, like this ...

I came to think that praising someone for what they are already good at, is a waste of an interaction. The person being praised learns nothing, especially if you or others have said it before. The praiser misses a chance to make any sort of difference. 

Rather, I think it's better to guide someone in the direction of things they don't like to do, then praise them when they do it. Like when a person who fears confrontation, takes the plunge and confronts difficult people. Or when a decidedly non-athletic person makes a big effort to get out there and do something more athletic. 

Interestingly, through the lens of living in Japan, people criticize more when you're _uchi_ rather than _soto_. When you are a part of the group (family, company, club), the criticism is harsh, because "otherwise who else would ever say this." It's a bit dysfunctional if you ask me, because criticism gets tiring whether you're giving or receiving.
