Our oldest got her first full time job last year, and it finally started (things start in April in Japan). It's a new chapter for her and for us. 

<!--more-->

Whether it's school, a fiscal year, or work, in Japan, it usually starts in April. It makes sense. It's time for renewals and Spring (at least in the northern hemisphere). 

My wife and I are watching what she is going through with some nostalgia and chagrin, since she's on with a new stage of life. A lot of new experiences for her; a lot of remembrances for us. 

So for now, we steward our youngest daughter through college and into her own independent life, and watch with warm eyes as our oldest embarks on adulthood (gulp, I still can't imagine it!) 

Good luck, Kylie!
