I was thrilled to see that my favorite corps Santa Clara Vanguard has picked up Michael Gaines as their "Creative Director".

I'm not sure what that really is, but, even if Gaines is not writing their drill, I'm sure he will have a positive impact on the organization. From [their blog post](http://www.scvanguard.org/vanguard-welcomes-michael-gaines-as-creative-director/): 

> Gaines is a welcome addition to the extremely talented SCV design team of Scott Koter (Program Coordinator), Denise Bonfiglio (Staff Coordinator), Andy Toth (Visual Program Coordinator), Adam Sage (Program Consultant), Pete Weber (Visual Designer/Drill Writer), J.D. Shaw (Brass Arranger/ Composer), Paul Rennick (Percussion Arranger/ Caption Manager) and Sandi Rennick (Percussion Arranger/Composer)

Those are some heavy hitters, who have variously produced some of the best drum corps shows _ever_. Looks like they are ahead of the curve this year in terms of planning, which is fantastic. 

Maybe this year, "Send in the Clowns" won't be as appropriate! I am hoping for the best.  

:congratulations: :trophy:
