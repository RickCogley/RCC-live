Feeling nostalgic and we're really "reelin' in the years" now. Check it out ...

Had a combined birthday dinner yesterday, at a favorite local restaurant "Petit Papillon". Akiko is, er, "not yet 50" and our baby Julie is 20. We chose this date because it was one where everyone, including my mother-in-law, were available. The food was as always; great. And a lot of milestones were celebrated.  

Julie is chugging along in college, trying to figure out what she wants in life. I'd say that's pretty normal. She enjoys playing percussion in bands, so that is kind of cool to watch. She is 20, so she can legally have a drink. She had a cocktail, and turned a little red from it. Additionally, our oldest Kylie has got a job at an electronics retailer, and has been assigned to the mobile team. She is spending her time studying a myriad of mobile phones and their options. She beams when she gets a sale. We love to see that.  

Time flies by so fast. About 30 years ago, I arrived here in Japan at age 21, and now our daughters are that age. They're growing up and we're growing old, reelin' in the years.
