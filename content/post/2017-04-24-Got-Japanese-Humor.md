I like comedy, because I like to laugh, and because there's already a lot of serious stuff in life.

Japan has some interesting comedy styles that are good to know for learners of Japanese. It might be really, really esoteric to those who don't speak any Japanese, but if you're trying to get from intermediate to advanced _any_ language, listen to comedy in that language. In Japanese, you want to look into "owarai". 

Japan is no exception and has a few types of humor such as standup styles manzai, rakugo, or conte, and written styles like senryu. 

**Manzai** acts are almost always a "double act" pair like Abbott and Costello, and it's characterized by rapid fire talk, back and forth between a "tsukkomi" straight man, and a "boke" funny man. There are some good shows on TV here, like the M-1 Grand Prix,
