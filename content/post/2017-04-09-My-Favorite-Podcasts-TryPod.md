I'm late to the party, but the Podcasts I listen to have been asking listeners to share their favorites on Social Media, so here goes.  

<!--more-->

I live in Japan. Although there's English news here, I like radio, and Podcasts are a great way to keep up with what is going on outside our little archipelago. We're pretty cloistered here. 

For the last couple of months, Podcast producers have been asking for shares, including the hashtag ``#TryPod``, so I thought I would list up the ones I love to listen to. I can't stand queuing, but we do a lot of it while waiting for trains, so, podcasts come in handy. Also great for the train ride itself, too.  

You can subscribe to these podcasts from Apple iTunes, apps like Overcast or Castro on iPhone (I don't have an Android but there are a bunch of apps you can use like "BeyondPod", "Stitcher Radio" and others), or on apps from the podcast producers, like NPR's "NPR One" app. 

## My Favorite Podcasts

In no particular order: 

### From Moz://a

Mozilla does important work "to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all." The [Mozilla Manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/) is worth studying, and it's great that there is an organization fighting for us, the "Joe and Jane Users" of the Internet. I like the [Mozilla IRL](https://irlpodcast.org/about/) podcast, which makes the point that our online lives _are_ real life. 

### From NPR

Here's NPR's [directory](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/organizations/1), and among those, I love: 

* Invisibilia
* Planet Money
* TED Radio Hour
* How I Built This

### From PRX 

PRX sponsors a curated group of podcasts called "[RadioTopia](https://www.radiotopia.fm)", which keeps me deep into listening material such as gems like: 

* 99% Invisible
* ZigZag
* What Trump can teach us about Con Law
* The Memory Palace 
* The Allusionist
* Criminal 
* This is Love
* Song Exploder 
* Mortified 

### From CIR and PRX

PRX and the Center of Investigative Reporting co-sponsor a great one: 

* [Reveal](https://www.revealnews.org/)

### From WNYC Studios

WNYC produces many beloved podcasts. Read more at their [site](http://wnycstudios.wnyc.org/#our-shows), but here's my heavy rotation: 

* RadioLab
* More Perfect
* Freakonomics Radio
* More Perfect
* Here's the Thing

### From WBEZ Chicago

How could I forget Ira Glass team's stories "in three acts". I love these Podcasts from WBEZ: 

* This American Life
* Serial
* S Town

... and you can learn more at the [WBEZ website](http://interactive.wbez.org/podcasts/).

### Others

No less important, but here are a handful of other great ones: 

* From Glenn Ostlund: [MytholoGuy](https://itunes.apple.com/jp/podcast/mythologuy/id1427041103?l=en&mt=2) is a fantastic new family-friendly podcast that showcases stories from around the world. I wish I had had it when my kids were growing up. 
* From Stitcher: Stephen Dubner's [Tell Me Something I Don't Know](http://tmsidk.com/about/)). Fake news antidote. 
* From Defacto Sound: [20000 Hertz](https://www.20k.org/). Want to know all about "that sound"? 2K Hertz has you covered. 
* From Panoply: Malcolm Gladwell's [Revisionist History](http://revisionisthistory.com/about). Revise away; it's so entertaining. 
* Kevin Allison's [Risk!](http://risk-show.com) podcast. It's kind of an adult version of "Mortified". 

And that's a wrap. If you've not got into podcasts, check out the ones above. You're sure to branch out and find other ones you love, among the great content that's being produced these days. Enjoy!
