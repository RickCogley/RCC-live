I had seen these national pride posters that an article reminded me of...

<!--more-->

A few years ago there were some posters floating around Tokyo here and there, regarding being proud to be a Japanese. An article (see link below) shows one. It says:  

> I'm glad I'm Japanese  
> Let's Raise the Hinomaru Flag with Pride in our Hearts

Well, that's my translation. The large text could be translated as "I'm glad I was born Japanese" too, but, it doesn't touch on birthright, rather just a state of being.  

When I saw it, I thought "ah, a patriotism poster, great". Thing is, we now know the model is Chinese. It _would_ be interesting if the creator of this _knew_ the model was Chinese, and meant to state that "blood" does not matter. But I seriously doubt it. It's apparently from Getty Images, which you use by simply picking photos and paying for the right to use it in your ad or website or whatever. This inadvertent gaffe just strikes me as funny, and makes me wonder how the heck people figured that out!? Must have a lot of time on their hands.  

Being married to a Japanese citizen and having mixed-race kids, my hackles rise when I hear ultra-conservatives start yapping on about "purity" of race. Ick, it gives me a rash. There's plenty to be proud of as a Japanese citizen, and I think it's ok to show pride in your country's accomplishments, or fly your country's flag. 

However, when it comes to shoving abstract notions of "purity" down peoples' throats? That I can't abide, and it's why I'll never stay at the unapologetically racist APA hotel.
