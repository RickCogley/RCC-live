Well of _course_ Japan isn't going to live up to its Health Ministry's promises to "ban indoor smoking". Here's what's up:  

<!--more-->

Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, or "MHLW", was selling some big promises (tall tales?) during the run-up to the decision to host the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, about "creating a smoke-free environment"". We non-smoking residents were really hoping it would happen, but I read in the Japan Times, that the Tobacco lobby has won a lot of concessions in the "secondhand smoke" amendment being discussed now.  

Things have improved since I arrived here in 1987, it's true. Most wards in Tokyo have no smoking or no butt-tossing ordinances on the streets, and most lunch spots are non-smoking during lunchtime, at least. I remember a few incidences of grabbing the wrist some smoking asshat, swinging his lit cigarette on a crowded street, to tell him to be careful. Those cigarettes are right about the level of a child's face, so, it's simple courtesy. 

The other day, I was kind of shocked to arrive at my usual barber, and realize that they had an ashtray in the waiting room. Some customer had been sitting there smoking three or four, judging by the butts in the ashtray, and the whole place stank. I guess smokers simply don't have the common sense to imagine that other people might find their nasty habit distasteful or just bad-smelling. 

Complaint, but it's not foreigners.
