Are you a project manager or, a manager of MS Project. That is...

<!--more-->


... is your selected tool impeding you rather than helping you? The more time spent fiddling with your tool (an apt metaphor here), the less time you're spending thinking and communicating about how people, things and money fit with your schedule and the goals you're aiming to meet. 

There may be projects that require a 5000-line Gantt chart, but the steering committees on the large projects I've worked have never needed it. In fact, most would question the sanity of a PM who shared or presented such a monstrosity.  

So, no matter your position, satisfy the real and pressing requirements of your projects, and stop fiddling with tools.
