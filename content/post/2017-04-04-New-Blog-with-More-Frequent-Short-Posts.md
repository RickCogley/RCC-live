I set up a new Hugo blog, this blog, with the idea of writing more frequent, shorter posts.  

<!--more-->

I'll leave my other blog at ``rick.cogley.info`` as my longform blog. 

This blog is generated using the world's fastest static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), uses the small and responsive [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) css toolkit (my main site uses "basscss" from the same developer), and the incredible [PragmataPro](https://www.fsd.it/s pro/) as its display font.

It's simple, and mostly text. The idea is really, to create content on the web, not inside a walled garden. If you have something to say, create some content, and reference this blog!
