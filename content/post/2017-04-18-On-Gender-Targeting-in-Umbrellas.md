As I walked in the rain to take the trash out this morning, I used my wife or daughter's umbrella, and was marvelling at how pretty the light is, when you're inside it.

I felt jealous of women and perhaps gay men, who might choose such beautiful designs, that set your world in a soft glow of color, on dreary days. The only non-black or blue umbrella I've owned is an oh-so-manly army camouflage one. 

Ellen Degeneres has a famous skit slamming gender marketing in Bic Pens, specifically the ones sold "for her". I agree about the points she makes, but at least here in Japan, it's the way things are done. We have all _manner_ of consumer products (such as the compact car Suzuki Lapin) that are targeted at women—mostly I think in color choices—and nobody bats an eye. 

Should this be? Should we not choose whatever color or design we like? If I had a nicely colored umbrella to use, maybe I wouldn't feel so dark on rainy days. :smile: 

By the way, **Happy Birthday!** to my lovely wife of many years, Akiko. May her umbrellas always be colorful. 
  
:heartpulse: :birthday: :congratulations:
