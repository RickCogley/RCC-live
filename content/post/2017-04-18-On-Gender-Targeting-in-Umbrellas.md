As I walked to take the trash out using my wife or daughter's umbrella, I was marvelling at how pretty the light is, when you're inside it.

I felt jealous of women and perhaps gay men, who would choose such beautiful designs, that set your world in a soft glow of color, on dreary days. The only non-black or blue umbrella I've owned is an oh-so-manly army camouflage one. 

Ellen Degeneres has a famous skit slamming gender marketing in Bic Pens, specifically the ones for women. But it's the way things are done in Japan. We have all manner of consumer products that are targeted at women, mostly I think in color choices, and nobody bats an eye. 

Should this be?

By the way, **Happy Birthday!** to Akiko! May her umbrellas be colorful.
