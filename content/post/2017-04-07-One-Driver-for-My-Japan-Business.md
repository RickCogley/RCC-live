My business gets business because Japanese are not so good at English.

With due respect to those Japanese who are fantastic speakers of English, my business [eSolia](https://esolia.com) gets business because Japanese speak English poorly. We act as an ombudsman between overseas businesses and their branches based in Japan. 

An article in the Japan Times this AM, ["Japanâ€™s latest English-proficiency scores disappoint"](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/04/06/national/japans-latest-english-proficiency-scores-disappoint/), proves my point. 

Having watched my kids grow up in the school system here in Japan, there is such a focus on memorization still, that there is just no way they could end up proficient in English. 

You have to learn a language like a baby does - through sound and repetition. That's always where to start, not by slogging through soul-crushingly long, eyesight-destroying lists of English vocab. Kids in Japan have vocabulary, but it's all in their head. They mostly can't speak, because they _don't_ speak in class. Their Japanese teachers are no better, and sometimes foist their awful, embarrassing pronunciation on their classes. I've seen _that_ nonsense first hand.  

The Gov't of Japan has been paying lip service to better learning of English since I came here in 1987 (damn, that's 30 years this August!), but I've seen only modest improvements. It's because of the illogical focus on rote memorization. 

_Monbusho_ just never change, do they.
