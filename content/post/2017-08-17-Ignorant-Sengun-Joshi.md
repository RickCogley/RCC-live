An article about _sengun joshi_ in the Japan Times got my hackles raised. Here's why:

Apparently _sengun joshi_ (先軍女子) are "miltary-first girls" and, their "celebrity" leader is one "Chunhun". She listens to North Korea propaganda songs to get ready for her day. The article I link below made my BP rise this AM. They are so well protected by this society, that they can do this sort of ignorant thing without a care.  

If their point is to support the North Korean _people_, that makes sense to me, but why sing propaganda songs and call yourself _sengun joshi_? That moniker is the proof in the pudding, and is, I submit, the reason people have the negative reaction they do, when hearing about this subculture. 

I suggest she go live there.
