Don't you think this about household appliances? ...

When it rains it pours. We recently replaced our refrigerator after 17 years. When we called the company and asked if they had parts, he laughed. What was funny, I wonder. Does everyone keep replacing their 'fridge after a couple years or something? Personally, I was going for 20. The new one is nifty. It has a mirror surface so you can see how fat you are, and a vacuum box for keeping cheese and so forth. It emits a pleasing "pshhh" sound when you open the box.  

Next, the laundry machine. This was probably 10-15 years old, but we use it for 3 loads a day so, I can see it must be worn out. It is refusing to spin properly, and has become downright contrary. We were trying to stretch it out, but got a notice from the water company that we were using an excessive amount of water and might want to look into whether there is a leak. (Japan is like that). We figured it was the repeated extra rinse cycles we had to do, to get the loads to complete. But when I looked at the water meter with everything turned off, sure enough, it was still spinning. So Akko had the plumber take a look, and sure enough, we had a big leak outside. So, we are now leak-less and have a new laundry machine coming.
